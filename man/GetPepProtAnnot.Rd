}
\arguments{
\item{spectroOut}{Spectronaut report of MS data.
Spectronaut report should have been exported using the Spectronaut schema SpectroSchema_LiPAnalyzerOut.}

\item{spectroOut2}{optional additional Spectronaut report, default is NULL.
Spectronaut report should have been exported using the Spectronaut schema SpectroSchema_LiPAnalyzerOut.}

\item{analysisLvl}{character defining the level on which the peptide/protein quantities should be exported.
'Peptide' by default, can alternatively be set to 'ModifiedPeptide' or 'Precursor'.
Should be identical to how \code{analysisLvl} defined in ExtractDataFromSpectro.}

\item{Precursor}{character giving the column name in which precursor IDs can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'EG.PrecursorId' by default.
Only used if \code{analysisLvl} is set to 'Precursor'.}

\item{modPeptide}{character giving the column in which modified peptide sequence can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'EG.ModifiedSequence' by default.
Only used if \code{analysisLvl} is set to 'ModifiedPeptide'.}

\item{Peptide}{character giving the column in which peptide sequence can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.StrippedSequence' by default.}

\item{Protein}{character giving the column in which protein names can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PG.ProteinGroups' by default.}

\item{AllProtein}{character giving the column in which all protein names mapping to a peptide sequence can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.AllOccurringProteinAccessions' by default.}

\item{NMissedCleavages}{character giving the column in which number of missed cleavages in each peptide can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.NrOfMissedCleavages' by default.}

\item{isProteotypic}{character giving the column in which annotation if the peptide is proteotypic can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.IsProteotypic' by default.}

\item{isTryptic}{character giving the column in which annotation of the digest type can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.DigestType....Trypsin.P.' by default.}

\item{start}{character giving the column in which start position in each peptide can be found in the Spectronaut report.
'PEP.PeptidePosition' by default.

 @return data.frame including all necessary annotation on peptides and proteins}
