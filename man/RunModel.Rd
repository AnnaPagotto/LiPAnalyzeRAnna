\usage{
RunModel(spectroList, annotS=NULL, formulaBVLS="Y~XPep+XProt",
formulaOLS="Y~Condition", lowBVLS=c(-1e9, 0, 0), upBVLS=c(Inf, Inf, Inf),
addBVLSbounds=FALSE, returnBVLSmodels=FALSE, returnOLSmodels=FALSE,
LiPonly=FALSE, withHT=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectroList}{A list of matrices, containing peptide/protein quantities.
Rows represent features and columns refer to the samples. Names of the list
items should be set to "LiPPep", "TrpPep" and "TrpProt" (if the LiP only
version is run, names should refer to "LiPPep" and "LiPProt").}

\item{annotS}{A data.frame containing sample annotation. Rows are samples and
must match to columns of \code{spectroList}.}

\item{formulaBVLS}{A character string or formula defining the bounded
variable least square models. Use 'Y' for defining the quantity matrix with
values to predict. ´ If additional quantity matrices should be used as
variables in the models, please refer to these as 'XPep' and/or 'XProt'. All
other variables in the formula should refer to columns in \code{annotS}. If
BVLS should not be run, set to 'NULL'. Default is defined as 'Y~XPep+XProt'.}

\item{formulaOLS}{A character string or formula defining the ordinary
variable least square models. Use 'Y' for defining the quantity matrix with
values to predict. ´If additional quantity matrices should be used as
variables in the models, please refer to these as 'XPep' and/or 'XProt'.
All other variables in the formula should refer to columns in \code{annotS}.
If OLS should not be run, set to 'NULL'. Default is defined as 'Y~Condition'.
If set to 'NULL', the residuals of the BVLS models will additionally be
returned.}

\item{lowBVLS}{A numeric vector defining lower boundaries of the coefficients
of the BVLS models. Elements refer to definition of \code{formulaBVLS}.
Default is defined as 'c(-Inf, 0, 0)'}

\item{upBVLS}{A numeric vector defining upper boundaries of the coefficients
of the BVLS models. Elements refer to definition of \code{formulaBVLS}.
Default is defined as 'c(Inf, Inf, Inf)'}

\item{addBVLSbounds}{A boolean value, if set to 'TRUE' as many bounds as
additionally needed in each BVLS model are added to \code{lowBVLS} and
\code{upBVLS}. Added boundaries are automatically set to -Inf for
\code{lowBVLS} and Inf for \code{upBVLS}. Important to set to 'TRUE', if you
are for example also running batch correction in the BVLS model.}

\item{returnBVLSmodels}{A boolean value, set to 'TRUE' if you want the
function to additionally return all BVLS models.}

\item{returnOLSmodels}{A boolean value, set to 'TRUE' if you want the
function to additionally return all OLS models}

\item{LiPonly}{A boolean value to set to 'TRUE' if you are running the
LiPonly version of the package and not providing trypsin-only data. Default
is set to 'FALSE'.}

\item{withHT}{A boolean value to set to 'TRUE' if LiPPep should only be
corrected for TrpProt only. Default is set to 'FALSE'.}
}
\value{
If run with BVLS & OLS or only OLS model it will return a list of two
data.frames, the first contains the model coefficients of the BVLS & OLS
model, the second one provides the p-values estimated in the OLS model. If
only BVLS is run, it will return a list of two data.frame, the first
containing the residuals of the BVLS model, the second one provides the
coefficients from the model. If \code{returnOLSmodels} and/or
\code{returnBVLSmodels} is set to 'TRUE', least square models for each
peptide will be exported as additional list elements.
