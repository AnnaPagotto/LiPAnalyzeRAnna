\usage{
PreprocessQuantityMatrix(SpectroList = NULL, QuantityMatrix = NULL, annotPP = NULL, annotS = NULL, logT = TRUE,
filterMinLogQuant = T, thresholdMinLogQuant = 10, filterNA = T, maxNAperCondition = 0,  infoCondition = "Condition",
filterTryptic = T, infoTryptic = "isTryptic", nameFT = "Specific",

}
\arguments{
\item{SpectroList}{a list of matrices, containing peptides/proteins quantities
Rows represent features and columns refer to the samples.
Can simply be output from \code{ExtractDataFromSpectro}.}

\item{QuantityMatrix}{single matrix with peptide/protein quantities.
Rows represent features and columns refer to the samples.}

\item{annotPP}{data.frame with peptide and protein annotation.
Rows are features and must match to the row.names of SpectroList/QuantityMatrix.
Must include all columns needed for filtering of data.}

\item{annotS}{a data.frame object containing sample annotation.
Rows are samples and must match to columns of \code{SpectroList}.
If NA filtering is set to true, needs to contain column about different conditions/groups.}

\item{logT}{a boolean value, defining if data should be log-transformed.
Default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{filterMinLogQuant}{a boolean value, defining small quantities should be set to NA.
Default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{thresholdMinLogQuant}{a numeric value, quantities below this threshold will be set to NA
if \code{filterMinLogQuant} = TRUE.
Default is 10. 12 would be an advised stricture choice.}

\item{filterNA}{a boolean value, defining peptides should be filtered based on number of NAs.
Default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{maxNAperCondition}{a numeric value, defining maximal number of NAs per condition.
Default is '0'.}

\item{infoCondition}{a character, providing column name of \code{annotS} in which condition is provided.
Default is 'Condition'.
If NA filtering should not be applied on condition level provide only one value in
\code{infoCondition} in \code{annotS}.}

\item{filterTryptic}{a boolean value, defining small peptides should be filtered based digest type.
Default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{infoTryptic}{a character, giving column of \code{annotPP} in which digest annotation is provided.
Default is 'isTryptic'.}

\item{nameFT}{a character, defining which peptide in \code{infoTryptic} should remain in the data.
Default is 'Specific'.}

\item{filterProteotryptic}{a boolean value, defining small peptides should be filtered based on if they are proteotypic.
Deault is 'FALSE'.}

\item{infoProteotypic}{a character, giving column of \code{annotPP} in which annotation if peptides is proteotypic is provided.
Default is 'isProteotypic'.}

\item{nameProteotypic}{a character, defining which peptide in \code{infoProteotypic}) is proteotypic
Default is 'True'.}

\item{filterMissedCleaved}{a boolean value, defining small peptides should be filtered based on number of missed cleavages.
Deault is 'FALSE'.}

\item{maxMissedCleave}{a numeric value, defining maximal number of missed cleavages allowed per peptide
Default is '2'.}

\item{infoMissedCleave}{a character, giving column of \code{annotPP} in which number of missed cleavage are provided.
Default is 'NMissedCleavages'.}
}
\value{
a list of matrices containing preprocessed and filtered
peptide and protein quantities.
OR a matrix containing preprocessed and filtered
peptide or protein quantities.
Rows represent features and columns refer to the samples.
}
\description{
Function for preprocessing data before fitting models.
Filtering can be applied based on different features such as digest type, proteotypic or number of missed cleavages.
