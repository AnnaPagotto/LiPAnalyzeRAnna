\title{Estimating end position of peptide sequences}
\usage{
GetEndPositionOfPep(annotPP, startCol = "startPosition", pepCol = "Peptide")
}
\arguments{
\item{annotPP}{a data.frame with peptide and protein annotation.
Rows are features. Data frame must include a column providing the start position of each peptide in the proteins
and one containing the peptide sequence peptides are provided.
Different start positions for the same peptide should be separated by
',' for peptides mapping to the same protein multiple times and
';' for peptides mapping to multiple proteins.}

\item{startCol}{a character defining column in which start positions of peptides are provided
'startPosition' by default.}

\item{pepCol}{character defining column in which peptide sequences are provide.
Peptide sequences have to be provided without modifications or charges.
'Peptide' by default.}
}
\value{
character vector of end positions of peptides
#' Different start positions for the same peptide should be separated by
',' for peptides mapping to the same protein multiple times and
';' for peptides mapping to multiple proteins.
}
\description{
Getting end position fo peptides sequences from the starting positions provided.
Function takes into account that peptides can map to multiple regions in the proteome.
